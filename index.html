    <h2>Memoir Blog Post</h2>
        <p>My wife and I are trying to buy a house. Well, “trying” implies there’s something in our way but there isn’t really. In truth we’ve been biding our time while going out too much, which shouldn’t be unexpected for newlyweds living with parents and looking for their first house.</p>
        <p>As soon as we could we got an apartment, a weirdly laid out one bedroom with a lofted living room. The unit was shaped like a shoe box standing on the short end with a small deck poking oåff the top that sat above our neighbors. A year later a larger corner unit became available and we made the short move by loading a beach cart with our possessions, taking the elevator up one level and rolling everything to the other end of the building like history’s laziest nomads.</p>
        <p>Although the building wasn’t very tall, especially compared to the Standard Oil building next door, the views were fantastic thanks to the small park that separates St. Paul street once it passes Center. Our deck bracketed the building, running the width of our apartment on the St. Paul side, and nearly the length of the entire building on the Center Street side. For most of the year the sunsets were vivid displays of color dotted with swooping and swurling before coming to rest on top of the Peabody building.</p>
        <p>At night during the warmer months there was enough open sky and after about ten the flow of traffic ebbed to the point where you could sit outside, enjoy a drink, and talk. My younger sister, Sarah, came over for dinner not long after we moved in and while showing her around a bright light and furious movement from across the street found the three of us at once. Our neighbor across the street, one half of a young couple who live on the second floor of the apartments on the other side of Centre street with their cat, had forgotten laptop screens give off quite a bit of light.</p>
        <p>It wasn’t the last time Sarah visited, but it was the last time she visited at night.</p>
        <p>If it weren’t for the total incompetence and carelessness of the management company, and the feeling we were throwing away our money on rent, we’d still be living on that deck, watching the sun set behind the Walters Art Museum.</p>
        <p>But after five years of dealing with a few weeks here and there without either heating or air conditioning, two bikes stolen from a third floor storage closet, and nearly a full year of having to pass “the screaming lady” in the lobby, we decided not to renew our lease, and now for the past year and a half we’ve been living with my in-laws in their Locust Point end-of-row townhouse.</p>
        <p>This is not the first time we’ve lived here with them. We stayed for about a year the first time. Really Mary Claire lived with her parents and I slept downstairs on a daybed for the few hours between my shifts at a bar next to Camden Yards and struggling to finish my last few undergrad classes. Then it was off to the apartments, and now we’re back, albeit in very different stages of our lives.</p>
        <p>In the first six months of our marriage we moved in with her parents, my father died from COVID and I started a new job. We are worlds away from where we were the first time we lived here, and the living experience, at least on my end, is extremely different.</p>
        <p>My in-laws are good people and good parents to their adult children. I’m sure they didn’t expect to become roommates, and office-mates, to two adults in their early 30s. The difference in schedules, lifestyles and eating habits must be grating for them, too. I’m sure the snarky remarks thinly disguised as jokes don’t help either.</p>
        <p>Any minor annoyance is more than balanced out by the sheer abundance of kindness my in-laws have shown us. We’ve been living rent-free for the past 18 months, and can continue to until the house of our dreams appears.</p>
        <p>One of the few good decisions venture capitalist ever made in the tech industry is refraining from throwing money at a promising smell-o-vision technology. The down side is you can’t know the home you’re touring was owned by smokers who only ate tilapia from the online listing. You also don’t get how the floors squish when you walk past the beautiful bay windows, or, most importantly, what the neighbors are like.</p>
        <p>Growing up in southwest Baltimore County, the City was only talked about as a hell-scape with nothing to offer. The only reason to risk going into the City, as far as anyone in my entire childhood and adolescence was concerned, was to catch an O’s game (Ravens tickets are too expensive).</p>
        <p>Relatives still look at me like I’ve refused to give up smoking when told again that, yes we are still in the City, and yes, we do intend to buy a home there. These are people that have lived the majority of their lives a 15-minute drive from the Inner Harbor.</p>
        <p>It’s a surprisingly common sentiment, even today, and I think T.V. news is mostly to blame but you can never discount racism. When you’ve been told your neighbors are scary and dangerous for the past 30 years, you have a hard time seeing people as people and not a threat.</p>
        <p>I speak as someone insulated against the worst woes of Baltimore City, so these words do not carry much water. All I know is this place is my home and if people keep moving out an already beleaguered city government will have an even smaller tax base to rely on.</p>
        <p>I think staying in the city is an important part of trying to help it, but does buying a home in Canton, Fells Point or Hampden really do anything to impact neighborhoods with a greater need? I know we’re just one couple, buying one house in a city that’s seen its population decline steadily since the 1960s. But that’s part of the point.</p>
        <p>Like any major decision in a new marriage it’s been exciting and surprising. While we’ve only been married a little over a year, we’ve been together for nearly a dozen. We know now how to ask and suggest and the importance of coming from a place of honesty and consideration. And of course, we’re always trying to learn and grow, but no relationship is perfect.</p>
